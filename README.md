# Albert Lungu – Computer Science Portfolio

Welcome to my **Computer Science Portfolio**! This repository showcases projects, experiments, and coursework that reflect my skills, creativity, and passion for computer science. It is intended for university applications and provides insight into the work I’ve done across programming, software development, and computational thinking.  

## About Me
I am currently a **Grade 11 IB student at Merivale High School**, with strong interests in:  
- **Software Development** – building applications and tools in Python, Swift, and JavaScript  
- **Algorithms & Data Structures** – exploring efficient problem-solving techniques  
- **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning** – experimenting with AI-based projects  
- **Web Development** – designing interactive websites with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and libraries like Chart.js  

I enjoy challenging myself with projects that combine **creativity, logic, and technical skills**.
